								<p>Fifty-two LEDs in two million colors add up to infinite possibilities of pattern and animation. With a powerful computer and Wifi connectivity, there&rsquo;s no end to the ways Moore&rsquo;sCloud Light can work for you. It&rsquo;s the light you&rsquo;ll live your life by.</p>

							<p>You wake up. It&rsquo;s dark. Still the middle of the night. But you have to get up, so you reach out to your nightstand and tap your Light. It turns on, and, just a moment later, so does every other Light between your bedroom and the bathroom, illuminating your way.</p>
							<p>This &lsquo;landing strip&rsquo; is just one of the countless applications for the Light by Moore&rsquo;sCloud. Connected intelligence gives the Light enormous capabilities, including the ability to talk to other devices (including other Lights), within your home or anywhere in the world. As part of the connected world, the Light can listen and respond, speak and command. Light by Moore&rsquo;sCloud is a portal which can control other devices, and a device which can be controlled. It can be bright and beautiful, subtle and sensitive, or urgent and insistent. How the Light behaves is up to you.</p>

							<p>Light by Moore&rsquo;sCloud is the best nightlight you&rsquo;ve ever owned. It will put you to sleep at night with a soft play of fading colors, and wake you up in the morning with a gentle splash of illumination. It can create a diffuse glow to dispel the monsters in the dark, or - with a tap - grow to full brightness.</p>
							<p>Choose any of the Light&rsquo;s two million colors to match any decor, holiday, or emotion. Snap a photo of a flower with your smartphone, and the Light instantly matches that color, creating an illumination that accentuates. With the soothing flicker of a candle or the mesmerizing intensity of a roaring fire, the Light can accentuate a mood, or set the scene.</p>
							<p>Tirelessly monitoring anything you consider important - weather reports, traffic conditions, market fluctuations, the Light puts that information to work for you, to help you protect your family, avoid frustration, even take advantage of an emerging opportunity. You can set alarms and triggers that translate events in the outside world into actions performed by the Light.</p>
							<p>Acting as a hub for the the growing range of connected, intelligent devices, gadgets like <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/limemouse/lifx-the-light-bulb-reinvented">LIFX</a>, 	<a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/smartthings/smartthings-make-your-world-smarter">SmartThings</a>, and <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/607691307/ubi-the-ubiquitous-computer-voice-activated-and-al-0">Ubi</a> all seamlessly integrate with the Light, because it is designed to work seamlessly with any connected device. Light fits into your home automation system, either as a controller or a device controlled by another. You can use the Light to control the rest of your home, from anywhere in the world.</p>
							<p>The connected power of the Light allows it to harmonize with other media, such as electronic books, music, broadcasts and internet streams. Imagine flipping the pages of a children&rsquo;s storybook as the lighting changes to match, or a light organ streamed live from a concert venue, or a synchronized control of the lights that accentuates the scary bits of a horror film. It&rsquo;s all possible. </p>				
							<p>Shipping with Moore&rsquo;sCloudStudio, an application designed to bring out the creative side of everyone, the Light will let you sculpt with light, create animations and patterns, develop your own unique look - then share it with friends. Moore&rsquo;sCloudStudio ensures every Light becomes as individual and unique as the person who owns it.</p>
							<p>Like a smartphone, every Light comes with a set of apps. The preceding examples detail some of the apps that come preinstalled with the Light, but that&rsquo;s far from the end of the Light&rsquo;s capabilities. The Moore&rsquo;sCloud App Store will offer thousands of tested, secure, and user-rated applications and animations to choose from.</p>
							<p>We get very excited when we imagine all the possible applications for the Light, and we see our job as creating the best possible foundation to support an ecology of delightful and useful apps. All our work is open, because we want anyone with a good idea to be able to find all the support they need to turn their idea into reality. We aim to succeed, and we believe we stand the best chance for success when we help others succeed.</p>

							<h2>Design</h2>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="seven columns">
							<p>Simplicity requires effort. Many modern devices bewilder with options thoughtlessly offered up. Against this, a pure geometric form feels like a relief, a holiday from the mind-bending load of too many gadgets trying to do too many things simultaneously. We are drawn to the single button, the simple switch, the click-and-done. The best designs hide an inner sophistication within simplicity. They facilitate, but never overwhelm.</p>
							<p>Light from Moore&rsquo;sCloud reflects this design philosophy.</p>
							<p>Technically, the Light is simply a string of LEDs connected to a small-but-powerful computer running LINUX. This has not been done before (because computers have always been too big and too expensive), and marks the major design innovation, setting the Light apart from the vast majority electronic gadgets. </p>
							<p class="more">More &raquo;</p>

						<div class="five columns">
							<img src="images/aside-render.png" alt="light by moorescloud, design renders from various angles" />
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="row moar">
						<div class="seven columns">
							<p>That computer enables the Light to run sophisticated applications, display beautiful animations, control or be controlled by other devices. Internet-connected (through WiFi), the Light hosts a full Web server, so you can interact with it through a smartphone, tablet, laptop or desktop computer, accessing it as you would any other site on the Internet.</p>
							<p>When a device is Internet-accessible, an endless range of possibilities opens up. They can control other computers and devices, or be controlled by them. For example, the Light can display a warning - a red flashing light - based on its own analysis of the current weather forecast. Light is itself intelligent enough to look for the weather report, scan it for emergency warnings, and initiate the appropriate alarm if the right conditions are met. Light is also capable of listening to the commands of other computers; a computer on the other side of the world could tell the Light to portray a particular pattern of lights (or play an animation) when a stock price falls to a certain level, when the temperature rises beyond a particular point, or when your favorite football team scores a goal.</p>
							<p>These two examples barely scratch the surface of what&rsquo;s possible. It will be some time until we feel we have plumbed the depths of the Light&rsquo;s capabilities. </p>
							<p>To encourage exploration, the design of the Light is entirely open. <strong>Everything aspect of our work is being released under open source licenses</strong>: the hardware and software, all our tools and techniques. We believe that a resource shared is a resource squared, and we know the only way the Light can realize its potential is in partnership with a community, sharing knowledge in an exploration of the capabilities of the device. We believe the community will find uses for the Light we never imagined.</p>
							<p>The best design is a reliable one. No one likes a gadget that breaks after a few days of play. We&rsquo;ve gone to great lengths to create a manufacturable product. The design and manufacture of consumer electronics has subtleties that stymie the best firms in the world. Though our hardware is not excessively complicated, it must be resilient, durable and accessible, so people can play with it, drop it, adapt it, and rework it. Light has to resist the rough play of children and clumsy adults, while providing years of trouble-free operation within a form that looks as good dark as illuminated.</p>
							<p>Good design is more than just a thing of beauty. Good design is good investment, and the best designs unlock creative potential in everyone who uses them.</p>

						<div class="seven columns">
							<p>For over thirty years, computers have grown smaller, faster and cheaper. Today&rsquo;s mobile is as powerful as the supercomputers of a generation ago. As computing becomes inexpensive, perfectly ordinary devices can take advantage of a sprinkling of intelligence. No longer ordinary, these devices can think and act for themselves, on our behalf. We can embed our intelligence into the environment, so that the world can think along with us, and help us to think.</p>
							<p>We are at the cusp of this transformation of an inanimate world of inert objects into a &lsquo;playful&rsquo; world of pervasive, connected intelligence. Technology costing a hundred dollars just a few years ago can now be had for less than ten, a watershed moment. Anything can be brought to life with a handful of chips and little more than pocket change. Everything we make is being touched by this revolution of connected intelligence.</p>

							<p>The lightbulb is the oldest of the electric technologies - the earliest example dates back over two hundred years - and the most familiar. Turning night into day, the lightbulb allowed us to rewrite time in our own image. Although presented in nearly endless variations, the lightbulb has remained essentially the same: flip a switch, turn it on; flip it again, turn it off. In a world before pervasive cheap computing and connectivity, that was all we could reasonably expect from our lights: they would illuminate when we applied power to them.</p>
							<p>Things have changed.</p>
							<p>Powerful microprocessors capable of running sophisticated software cost just a few dollars, and can be added to nearly any electrical device. When combined with LEDs - those modern equivalents of the incandescent light bulb - it becomes possible to have very fine control over color and brightness. Put these LEDs under computer control, and patterns and animations become possible. Connect this collection of LEDs and computing to the Internet, and suddenly it becomes responsive to people and services throughout the world. No longer just a lightbulb, it has become a meeting point between the online and real worlds - the Light.</p>
							<p>Devices like the Light represent the first wave of the &lsquo;Internet of Things&rsquo; - connected, intelligent devices possessing an awareness of themselves and the world around them. Just as we all benefit from the shared knowledge of Wikipedia, connected, intelligent devices can help us by sharing their own knowledge and observations. We don&rsquo;t yet know much about how our connected devices will organize themselves for our benefit; as with any new thing, people think best when they they have it in their hands.</p>
							<p>MooresLights was formed to create a range of connected, intelligent devices. We believe the whole world is tipping over into greater intelligence than any we have ever known; lights are just the first and most visible element in that transformation. As we redesign the world around inexpensive connected intelligence, the energies released are powering us into another golden age of invention. We intend to be at the forefront.</p>
